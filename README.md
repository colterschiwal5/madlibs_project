# Contributers

- Kai - story writer and tester
- Andrew - tester
- Sofia - story writer and debug
- Ava - coder and storywriter

# Approach
- We used a list for the words in each story 
- We made stories on our own and then combined them in the app
- We used a while loop to keep the user in the game and divided each story up into if statements

# Challenges
One challenge we faced was how to only ask the user for input for the story that they choose. We solved this by creating the lists for each story inside it's elif statement

# Features
- User can choose what story to play
- User can stay in the app to play again and exit when they want
- Variety of stories
- 4 different stories
